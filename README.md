# Monday Bot: Discord Edition
A Node.js Discord bot that writes "Monday!" every Monday at midnight London time.

Get the libraries needed: ```npm i```

Note: by default, the commands only work on Bloops' Discord server. Change the guildId to yours in config.json or make the commands global by modifying deploy-commands.js

Made for Bloops.
